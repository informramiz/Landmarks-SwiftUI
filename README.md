# Landmarks-SwiftUI
This is a very simple app written to be a showcase of the **SwiftUI** essentials. 

![demo](docs/demo.gif)

### SwiftUI Features Used

- Multiple Screens
- CustomViews
- Usage of UIKit views inside SwiftUI
- TableView
- StateBinding (a view change updates data and data update changes view)
- ObservableObjects (so that change in an object's fields is automatically reflected in the views)
- EnvironmentObjects (so that a data passed on top of hierarchy is made available to all the views down the hierarchy)
